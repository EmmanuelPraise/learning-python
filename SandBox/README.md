## Voting System Project
### Beginner Steps
1. **Setup Project Environment**
   - Install Python and set up a virtual environment.
   - Create a new project directory and initialize a Git repository.

2. **Create Candidate List**
   - Define a list of candidates.

3. **Create Voting Functionality**
   - Implement a function to allow users to vote for their candidate of choice.
   - Store votes in a dictionary with candidates as keys and vote counts as values.

4. **Display Results**
   - Implement a function to display the vote counts for each candidate. 
   - Sort the candidates based on the number of votes received.
   - Check for ties and handle them accordingly.
   - Implement a function to determine and display the winner.

### Intermediate Steps
1. **Input Validation**
   - Add input validation to ensure users can only vote for valid candidates.
   - Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

2. **Persistent Storage**
   - Implement functionality to save and load votes from a file (e.g., JSON or CSV).

3. **User Interface**
   - Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) for the voting system.
   - Provide clear instructions and feedback to the user.

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for the voting functions.
   - Ensure all edge cases are covered.

### Master Steps
1. **Advanced User Interface**
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.
   - Enhance the user experience with better design and usability.

2. **Real-time Voting System**
   - Implement a web-based voting system using a framework like Flask or Django.
   - Allow multiple users to vote simultaneously.

3. **Security**
   - Implement security measures to prevent multiple votes from the same user.
   - Ensure data integrity and protect against tampering.

4. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - Add functionality to generate detailed reports and analytics on the voting data.
   - Visualize the results using charts and graphs.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the web-based voting system to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Ensure the system is scalable and can handle a large number of users.
