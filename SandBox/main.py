# Leap Year conditions:
# A year is leap, if it is divisible by 4 and 400. But, not by 100.
# Write a python program to determine if it is a leap year or not

#year = int(input('Enter year: '))

#if year % 4 == 0 and year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 == 1:
  #  print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
#else:
 #   print(f"{year} is a common year.")
